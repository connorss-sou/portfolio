	<h2> Contributor View Homepage </h2>
	<h4> Author: Sean Connors </h4>
	<h4 style="display:inline;">Description: </h4>
	<p style="display:inline;"> This pages allows you to view catch records of contributors within a particular group. </p>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<h4 style="display:inline;">Justification: </h4>
	<p style="display:inline;"> This page is useful for all contributors, and allows for the actual viewing of the records. This is what would be displayed when a user is viewing the general catch records for the group they exist in, and would allow them to stay up to date on the catches in their area.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>Try looking at the Alaska Group first since at the time of writing this, there are more contributors in this group, and it should display 13 rows.
	However if you used the trigger before this, some groups may be different, so just play around and look at the catch records.
	Currently the locations don't match up since this is a matter of showing the concept, but in a real environment, somebody in Alaska would only be in a group for Alaska. You will 
	know that this worked if you see the catch records of users in the group. For instance, when I ran the test, alaska currently had 13 catch records from Sean (me), and Zixu.</p>
	<p>Please select a group you'd like to see records of: </p>
