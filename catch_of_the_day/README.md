# Catch of the Day
### A simple fishing social media application
### CS-460 Advanced Databases

This is a group project that one other teammate and I created during college. The original idea of this project was to create an application where a user could share and record fish caught on a fishing trip. As users input information into the database, a user can use the front end interface in order to view interesting specific data. For example, a user can use the "Location of largest Fish" procedure in order to select a location and see the specifics of the largest fish at that location. Take a look and explore the page and check out some of the recorded catch data!

### Note:

Since this was a group project, I only created half of the functionality for this site, so I only added the code that I created. My contributions can be seen under my name on the home page!
